->CREATING PYTHON IMAGE AND RUNNING THAT IMAGE 
	AND PUSHING THAT INTO DOCKER HUB
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> First create a folder on desktop named hey-python
-> create python file(index.py) inside hey-python folder.
-> Inside index.py file write code.
	[print hello world using flask]
-> create requirements.txt file inside hey-python folder.
	.Inside this file write requirements you need for 
	this image in this case we only need flask.
	. so we write flask inside requirements.txt file
-> create a file named as "Dockerfile" inside hey-python folder.
	--Inside dockerfile
	.First write FROM python:3-alpine3.15	#(ImageName)
	.WORKDIR /app	#here app is working directory
	.COPY . /app  	#here we are copying code from current dir
			# to app dir 
	.RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
		[It will install all the requirements that are 
			mentioned in requirements.txt file]

	.EXPOSE 3000	#it will run on host machine at port no 3000
	.CMD python ./index.py  #This cmd will run index.py file

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
->Now open terminal in vscode or go to cmd prompt
	Enter into[Desktop\Docker\hey-python>]
1. Now run following command
	...> docker build -t beigh123/hey-python-flask:0.0.1.RELEASE . 
	.This will build the image named "hey-python-flask:0.0.1.RELEASE
	.Now go inside images and check is it there or not.
	[-t stands for tag]

2. Now We can run this image as a container by using below command.
	...> docker run -d -p 3000:3000 beigh123/hey-python-flask:0.0.1.RELEASE
	.This will run a container on port 3000 on local machine.
	[Here first 3000 is port no of local machine 
		and second 3000 is port number of image container.]
	. -d stands for detached mode
3. Now we can push this image to docker hub.
	..>docker push beigh123/hey-python-flask:0.0.1.RELEASE
