-------------------------------------INTRODUCTION TO DOCKER-----------------------------------------

-> WHAT IS DOCKER?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	ANS: Docker is a software platform that allows you to build, test, 
		and deploy applications quickly.

->  Docker Containers?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	1. Docker Containers contain binaries, libraries, and configuration files
		along with the application itself.
	2. They donâ€™t contain a guest OS for each container and rely on the 
		underlying OS kernel, which makes the containers lightweight.
	3. Containers share resources with other containers in the same host OS 
		and provide OS-level process isolation.
	4. It is a runtime instance of an image.
	5. Allows developers to package applications with all parts needed such 
		as libraries and other dependencies.
-> Docker Image?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	.It is a file, comprised of multiple layers, used to execute code in a Docker container.
	.They are a set of instructions used to create docker containers.

-> Docker file?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	.It is a text document that contains necessary commands which on execution helps assemble 
		a Docker Image.
	.Docker image is created using a Docker file.
	

-> What is a container image?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	ANS- When running a container, it uses an isolated filesystem. 
	This custom filesystem is provided by a container image. 
 	Since the image contains the container's filesystem, 
 	it must include everything needed to run the application - all dependencies, 
 	configuration, scripts, binaries, etc. The image also contains other configuration 
 	for the container, such as environment variables, a default command to run, 
 	and other metadata.
