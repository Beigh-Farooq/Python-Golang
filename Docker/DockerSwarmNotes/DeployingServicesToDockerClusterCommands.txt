-> Creating a service on Swarm:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
	command:# docker service create --name myservice --replicas 3 
		 --publish 80:80 httpd  
	- Above command will create service httpd(appache server) inside cluster.
	- This means it will create 3 services on 3 nodes one service on
	  each node.
	- Here replicas means it will create create 3 instances of httpd service
	  inside cluster nodes which means that it makes your service up always.
	command# docker service create --name demo --replicas 6 --publish 80:80
		 httpd
	    - We have one master node and two worker nodes
		Two services on master node, two on worker node1 and 2 on worker
		node2

	-> Command to view service:
	---------------------------------------
	cmd# docker service ls
	-> To see where is your service running:
	----------------------------------------
	cmd:# docker ps myservice
		or
	 - go to any worker nodes putty session and run below command
	 cmd:# docker ps  -(you get a container that is running on this worker node)


	-> If any worker node removes service what will happen:
	-------------------------------------------------------
	 . Command to remove service from a node
	   cmd#: docker rm -f myservice.1.wpx.....m5
	 . Now run # docker ps
	   service is removed 
	 . Now after a second if we run # docker ps 
	   you will get service is running again this is the job of docker swarm
	   If anyone of the node is down other two nodes make it up and running.
