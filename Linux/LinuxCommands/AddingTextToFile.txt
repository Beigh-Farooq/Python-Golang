-->ADDING TEXT TO FILES
	3 simple ways to add text to a file
	.vi
	.Redirect command output > or >>
	.echo > or >>
	
	-->echo:
	SYNTAX: # echo "text u want to add" > filename
	EXAMPLE:# echo "Hello world" > jerry
	--Appending Text
	Example:# echo "how are you" >> jerry
	o/p:# Hello world
	      how are you
	
	--Redirect command output
	Syntax: ls -l >> filename
	Example:# touch listingofdir
		# ls -l >> listingofdir
		# cat listingofdir

--INPUT AND OUTPUT REDIRECTS
	THERE ARE 3 REDIRECTS IN LINUX
	1. standard input(stdin) and it has file descriptor number as 0
	2. standard output (stdout) and it has file descriptor number as 1
	3. standard error(stderr) and it has file descriptor number as 2

	OUTPUT(stdout)- 1
	-----------------------------------
	.By default when running commands its output goes to the terminal
	.The output of a command can be routed to a file using > symbol
		Example:#ls -l > listingofdir
			#pwd > findpath
	.If using the same file for additional output or to append to the same file then use >> 
		.Eg: # ls -la >> listingofdir  (la outputs hidden files)
		     # echo "Hello world" >> findpath

-->STANDARD OUTPUT TO A FILE(tee command)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
."tee" command is used to store and view(bot at the same time) the output of any command
.The command is named after T-splitter used in plumbing.It basically breaks the output
of a program so that it can be both displayed and saved in a file.It does both the tasks simultaneously,
copies the result into the specified files or variables and also display the result.
Example:# echo "Hello world" | tee eleni-david
	# echo "eleni is gf of david" | tee -a eleni-david (-a will append the text)
	# wc -c eleni-daid (This command will output no of characters in file)
	# ls -l | tee listofdir
