-->CREATING FILES

1. Creating Files in Linux using touch
	cmd touch filename
	eg touch jerry
	We can create multiple files using one touch command
	cmd touch filename filename filename filename ...
	eg touch bart lisa marge
2.Using cp (Copy Command)
	cmd cp fileName(Whichuwantocopy) destinationFileName
	eg cp jerry lex
	eg cp jerry clark
	eg cp jerry lois
3.Using vi command
	cmd vi filename
	eg  vi homer
	After Running this command file is opened
	to exit from opened file run following command
	cmd :wq!
--CREATING DIRECTORIES
Using mkdir
	cmd mkdir directoryName
	eg mkdir sienfeld

	#We can create Multiple directories using single command
	cmd mkdir directoryName directoryName directoryName
	eg  mkdir superman simpsons


-->LINUX FUNDAMENTALS

Command Syntax: command option arguments
		eg ls   -ltr  
		eg of removing directories
		   rm	-r	Newfolder(DirectoryName)

	-->File Permissions
	There are 3 types of permissions
	. r - read
	. w - write
	. x - execute a file
	Each permission(rwx) can be controlled at three levels:
	. u - user(yourself)
	. g -group(can be people in the same project)
	. o - other(Everyone on the system)
	
	Example: execute this command on linux terminal
		# ls -l jerry(filename)
		Above command which give this output
		-rw-rw-r--.
		here first - means it is a file
		. rw- means user has permission to read and write file but not to execute.
		. rw- means group has permission to read and write file but not to execute.
		. r-- means others have only read permission.
	REMOVING PERMISSION TO A FILE USING(chmod command or change mod)
	.Example # chmod g-w jerry
		.Here g-w means remove write permission to group in file jerry
		.Now we will get: -rw-r--r--

	IF WE WANT TO REMOVE read PERMISSION TO ALL.
	.EXAMPLE # chmod a-r jerry
	      o/p# --w-------
	IF WE WANT TO REMOVE WRITE PERMISSION IN SPECIFIC LEVEL:
	EXAMPLE: # chmod u-w jerry
	      o/p# ----------
		Now if we want to remove jerry file (rm jerry) we cann't remove.
		If we want to write in jerry file by(cat jerry) it will show permission denied.

	GIVING PERMISSIONS BACK TO A FILE:
	EXAMPLE: # chmod u+rw jerry
		 # chmod g+rw jerry
		 # chmod o+r  jerry 

	DIRECTORIES:
	.In directories x(executuable) means that we can enter(cd) in that file.
  	Now Remove x to all in seinfeld directory:
	EXAMPLE:# chmod a-x seinfeld
	     o/p# drw-rw-r--
		.Now if we cd into seinfeld it will show permission denied.
	GIVING PERMISSION BACK TO A DIRECTORY:
	EXAMPLE:# chmod a+x seinfeld
	o/p     # drwxrwxr-x.
	Now we can enter into seinfeld directory.
